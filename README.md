## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/soumya9832/ExpenseTracker.git
```

Go to the project directory

### 2. Gradle Sync:

- Android Studio will automatically start a Gradle sync to download all necessary dependencies and set up the project. Wait for this process to complete. If it doesn't start automatically, look for a "Sync Project with Gradle Files" icon (often a refresh button with a Gradle elephant icon) in the toolbar.
### 3. Run the App:

- Connect an Android device to your computer (ensure Wireless / USB debugging is enabled on the device).
- OR, select an Android Emulator from the device dropdown in Android Studio's toolbar.
